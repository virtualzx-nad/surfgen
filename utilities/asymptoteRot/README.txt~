~ asymptoteRot.x
-----------------------------------------------------------
This program was written by Christopher L. Malbon for 
 implementation in surfgen.x and surfJay.x (cthree-40's fork ).

This program rotates a dissociated atom goup around 3 axes,
 defined by the plane of AtomMid1, AtomMid2 and AtomSpec:
   	R1 = planar rotation
	R2 = out-of-plane rotation
	R3 = rotation on axis defined by R2 + R1

The program creates directories for each of the respective
 rotations.

The midpoint of AtomMid1 and AtomMid2 is placed at the origin.

The input is pretty bare-bones, but will be improved!
For now, here is what input.SAR should look like:
[number of atoms]
[AtomMid1]
[AtomMid2]
[Index of special atom ]
[Number of displacements]

Please send any bug reports to cmalbon1@jhu.edu, or post
 where applicable on www.github.com/cthree-40/surfJay.

Enjoy!
